# Kali-Update-Script

# Created by Nathan Clifford for Fleming College CSI Students

# Usage Instructions:
Copy this file to a location on your system (ie. ~/Desktop), ensuring that the file extension is .sh,
cd ~/Desktop, 
chmod u+x Update.sh,
sudo ./Update.sh,

# Description:
This script is for updating, and performing basic configuration on Linux
distros that use apt as the package manager (ie. Kali, Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu)
This means that if you're using a different package manager such as yum (ie. RedHat, Fedora, OpenSuse)
then this script will probably not work on your OS.
